Project Status
--------------

[Version changelog](https://github.com/TES3MP/openmw-tes3mp/blob/master/tes3mp-changelog.md)

Our project is not yet in a playable state, though we are getting close. At the moment we have synchronization of character appearance, character skills, stats, attributes and death, movement in interiors and exteriors, melee and ranged combat, spell casting, picking up and dropping items in the world, using doors and levers, and adding and removing items from containers, as well as [serverside Lua scripts](https://github.com/TES3MP/PluginExamples) used to save and load the state of most of the aforementioned.
